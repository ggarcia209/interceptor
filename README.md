Simulates two moving vehicles on a freeway and the time required for the following vehicle to intercept the leading vehicle given varying rates of speed for both vehicles.

Simulation is ran by instantiating Simulation() class and calling self.start_sim()

  ex: s1 = Simulation()
      s1.start_sim()
